Sure! Here is a step-by-step guide on how to set up and use the HTTP to SOCKS proxy server with caching for static elements.

### Instructions to Set Up and Use the HTTP to SOCKS Proxy Server

#### Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **pip**: Ensure you have `pip`, the Python package installer, installed.

#### Steps to Set Up the Proxy Server

1. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:

    ```sh
    pip install PySocks cachetools
    ```

3. **Run the Proxy Server**:

    Execute the following command to start the proxy server:

    ```sh
    python http_to_socks.py
    ```

    You should see a message indicating that the proxy server is running:

    ```
    HTTP to SOCKS proxy server running on localhost:8080
    ```

#### Using the Proxy Server

1. **Configure Your HTTP Client to Use the Proxy**:

    For example, if you are using `curl`, you can specify the proxy like this:

    ```sh
    curl -x http://127.0.0.1:8080 -s https://ifconfig.io
    ```

    This will route the request through the HTTP proxy, which will forward it to the SOCKS proxy.

2. **Verify Caching of Static Elements**:

    The server will cache static elements such as CSS, JavaScript, images, and fonts based on their file extensions. You should see a "Cache hit" message in the server logs for subsequent requests to the same static resources.

### Notes

- The script uses a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache to store responses for static files.
- You can adjust the cache size by modifying the `CACHE_SIZE` variable.
- Ensure your SOCKS proxy (e.g., Tor) is running and accessible on the specified `SOCKS_PROXY_HOST` and `SOCKS_PROXY_PORT`.

This setup should help you route HTTP requests through a SOCKS proxy while caching static resources for improved performance.
